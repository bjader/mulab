                    <p> This phenomenon of electron spin resonance used in this experiment involves the transition of an optically active unpaired electron. When atom is placed in an external magnetic field, this causes the energy levels to split. This is called the Zeeman Effect. </p>
                    <p>ESR involves a resonant coupling of the transition between Zeeman levels and an external oscillating electromagnetic field. When atom is placed in an external magnetic field, this causes the energy levels to split. This is called the Zeeman Effect. Electrons have charge and an intrinsic angular momentum called spin and thus must have a magnetic dipole moment, µ, antiparallel to the spin vector</p>

                      This energy shown in equation (2) is quantized because the magnetic moment and the total angular momentum can only take discrete orientations relative to the magnetic field. Each orientation of the angular momentum corresponds to a state with a particular potential energy in the magnetic field. The difference in these energies is found directly using electron spin resonance. So if the energy of this alternating field is equal to the difference in energy between two bordering energy levels and equation (2) is satisfied, then the alternating field causes the magnetic moments from one orientation of the magnetic field to flip to another.

                    <h2> Theory </h2>
                    <p> Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is based on the magnetic properties of the nucleus.  Like in ESR where the electron has an associated spin, the protons and neutrons also have an associated spin which means a nucleus that contains an unpaired proton and/or neutron has a magnetic dipole moment, $\mu$. </p>
                    <p> $$ \mu = g {\mu_n}$$ </p>
                    <p> Where ${\mu_n}$ is the nuclear magneton and $g$ is the g factor.
                      <p>This means that the theory outlined for ESR also applies to nuclei as well as electrons. When nuclei with spins of ½ such as protons are placed in a magnetic field, the spin axes of the nuclei undergo precession about the field direction instead of obediently flipping over and the magnetic moments aligning in the field direction. The frequency of this precession is known as the Larmor frequency, w, which is identical to the transition frequency.</p>
                      <p> $$\omega = \gamma B$$ </p>
                      <p> Where $\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ration and $B$ is the applied magnetic field </p>
                      <p> This means that if a nucleus of spin ½ is in a magnetic field, then the nucleus is in its lower energy level. When a magnetic field is present, the axis of rotation will precess around the magnetic field and its frequency is given in equation (4). The potential energy of this precessing nucleus is given by, </p>
                      <p> $$E = \mu B cos(\theta)$$ </p>
                      <p> Where $E$ is the energy and $\theta$ is the angle between the applied magnetic field and the axis of rotation. </p>
                      <p> So if the nucleus absorbs energy, then this angle will change. This means that for a nucleus, absorption of this radiation flips the magnetic moment so that it opposes the applied field and transitions to its higher energy state at a resonance frequency. This effect is known as Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).</p>

                      <p> Figure 1 consists of a Leybold didactic GMBH ESR basic unit (SE-9635) and it is driven by the Leybold didactic GMBH ESR control unit (SE-9636).</p>
                      <p>The ESR control unit provides all the required voltages needed to drive the probe unit and the Helmholtz coils, provides a digital readout of the radio frequency oscillation created by the probe units and it provides outputs for a dual trace oscilloscope.</p>  
                      <p> The output as shown on the Gould two channel 20MHz oscilloscope OS300 is proportional to the current in the radio frequency oscillator, and is used to observe the resonance pulses. The other output is proportional to the current that is supplied to the Helmholtz coils, and indicates the magnitude of the magnetic field. </p>
                      <p> The ESR basic unit (SE-9635) consists of a pair of Helmholtz coils with bases that are connected parallel to each other and is used to provide a highly uniform magnetic field in which to place the sample material for the ESR measurement.</p>
                      <p> The equipment set up and main components for this experiment are shown in Fig.1.  The experiment also consists of an ammeter which is used to record the current flowing 2I through the Helmholtz coils at the resonant frequencies and a Gauss meter attached to a Hall probe placed between the Helmholtz coils to ensure that the value of the magnetic field varies with coil current.</p>

                      <p> The DPPH is readily supplied in a small test tube which fits inside one of the small, medium and large copper inductance coils. Once an oscillating voltage is applied this generated a radio frequency radiation. Three copper coils of a different number of turns N are provided in this experiment and spans a range of frequencies driven by the ESR control unit. The small coil has 3 turns, the medium coil has 11 turns and the large copper inductance coil has 22 turns.  These give values for the Figure 1: The main components of the ESR experiment which show the ESR control unit and a basic unit with a coil holding a sample attached, an oscilloscope to display the ESR signal and two Helmholtz coils connected in parallel. 
                        resonant frequency displayed on the ESR control unit and the current flowing through the Helmholtz coils 2I on the ammeter. One of these coils is plugged into the socket on the Basic Unit to form part of an oscillator circuit which can be driven by the Control Unit at frequencies between 15 and 130MHz. 
                      </p>
                      <p> When the frequency matches the electron spin resonance frequency of the specimen the radiation from the coil will be strongly absorbed. This changes the impedance of the oscillating circuit, reducing the voltage at the coil and thus creating a signal which can be detected using an oscilloscope. A picoscope (PC oscilloscope) is provided for capturing the oscilloscope traces for printing out and analysis.</p>
                      <p> The external magnetic field, B, is generated by a pair of Helmholtz coils powered through the ESR Control Unit. This field has two components: a static field B0, which can be varied from 0 to about 4 mT by varying the coil current, and an alternating component at the mains frequency of 50Hz. The function of the alternating B field is to sweep the maximum field back and forwards through a small range of values, which makes it easier to detect the exact field value at which resonance occurs. (The frequency of this modulation is less than one millionth of the frequency of the radiation so the resonance condition will not be perturbed).</p>
                      <p> In general, there will be a time delay between the signal from the copper coil reaching the oscilloscope and the modulated magnetic field. This means that the two signals arrive at the oscilloscope out of phase with one another. The control unit includes an adjustable phase shift (labeled φ) to compensate for this effect.</p>

                      <p> A suggested procedure for initial measurements is as follows:  </p>
                      <p>
                        <ul>
                          <li> Mount the copper coil with the smallest number of turns in the Basic Unit </li>
                          <li> Turn on the ESR control unit. The unit senses automatically which coil has been fitted to the base unit and it will set the frequency automatically to a value close to the expected resonance </li>
                          <li> Set the modulation amplitude $U_mod$ to the second scale marking </li>
                          <li> Set the phase shift $\phi$ to zero</li>
                          <li> Set the oscilloscope to dual channel operation and choose an appropriate time base</li>
                          <li> Slowly increase the field of the Helmholtz coils by adjusting the voltage U0 until the resonance signals reach their maximum intensity. Fine adjustments can be made by varying the frequency slightly, using the knob on the top of the base unit. </li>
                          <li>Switch the oscilloscope to x-y mode and adjust the phase shift so that the two resonance signals coincide i.e in phase.</li>
                          <li>Vary the Helmholtz coil voltage until the resonance signal is symmetric. Set the modulation voltage as low as possible.</li>
                          <li>Record the current 2I0 through the Helmholtz coils and the resonance frequency, with their uncertainties</li>
                          <li>Change the frequency and repeat the procedure</li>
                          <li>Plot a graph of resonance frequency against B0 and use this to determine a value of the 
                            Landé g factor for DPPH.</li>
                          </li>

                        <p> The Leybold NMR supply unit (514 602) supplies the high frequency oscillating circuit in the measuring cell and the modulation coils of the NMR apparatus. It also works by amplifying the resonance signal during the observations of the transitions of the nuclear spin in an external magnetic field induced by high frequencies..</p>
                        <p>The Leybold AC/DC constant current power supply 0-15 V (512 501) was used a constant current source from up to 5A. The two outputs on the supply are isolated from each other, ungrounded and protected against short circuit and external voltages. The Leybold NMR probe (541 606) consists of a pair of modulation coils, set of NMR samples and a pair of holding clamps. The sample is placed inside the sample holder. Also used in the experiment is a Leybold oscilloscope 30MHz, two channel, analogous (575 214).  It displays the NMR signal which can be saved as a trace on the picoscope.</p>
                        <p> In this experiment you will use an electromagnet to provide the large static Bz and a set of smaller coils to add a small sinusoidal modulation ΔBz. As in the ESR experiment, the modulation will allow you to pass periodically through the exact NMR resonance condition at a fixed excitation frequency and thereby visualize the resonance on the oscilloscope in x-y mode. </p>

                        <ul>

                        <p class="background-eee"> Student Activity: Calibration of the field of the electromagnet is a must. Set the electromagnet coil current to zero. With no specimen in the chamber, carefully insert the Hall probe into the chamber to measure the magnetic field. Be very careful not to damage either the Hall probe or the sample coil inside the specimen cavity. Take measurements of the maximum field within the sample coil as a function of coil current for several values of current up to a maximum of 5A. For one value of current, measure the field as a function of depth in the specimen chamber. Over what distance is the field uniform enough for NMR measurements? Estimate the experimental uncertainty associated with non-uniformity of the magnetic field. </p>

                        <p> Set the current in the electromagnet to produce a field of the appropriate magnitude. With the oscilloscope in x-t mode, slowly adjust the field until you see an NMR signal. (How should the scope be triggered?) The NMR signal will appear as voltage spikes riding on the sine wave. Observe and record the effect on the NMR signal of adjusting the phase and amplitude of the ΔB output. Now set the scope to x-y mode. Again observe and record the effect of adjusting the phase and amplitude and comment on the results. Adjust the phase and amplitude of the NMR signal so that it has one central peak.</p>
                        <p> Measure the resonance frequency of glycerin as a function of magnet current for the full range of oscillator frequencies for which a signal can be detected. Since the magnetic field is hysteretic, you may wish to remove the sample and measure the field with the Hall probe at each setting. </p>
